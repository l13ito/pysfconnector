It is a simple python script to connect Salesforce in order to retrieve soql queries and metadata(Not implemented yet) results by terminal or csv file.

In a future, it will added additional options as:

-Check csv format
-Insert/Update/Delete record  bulking a csv file or by terminal.
-Retrieve Metadata.

How to use it:

-Open a linux terminal go to the script folder
